## 🚀 Sections Recreated

This project focuses on the core landing page components that define Cursor's unique look:

* **Global Navigation:** High-blur translucent header with navigation links and the "Download" button.
* **Hero Section:** The centerpiece featuring the "The AI Code Editor" headline, primary CTA buttons, and the distinctive glowing background gradients.
* **Editor Preview:** A styled container mimicking the Cursor IDE interface, showcasing the code-editing UI and AI chat panels.
* **Feature Bento Grid:** A responsive grid layout highlighting specific features like "Tab to Tab," "Command K," and "Composer."
* **Interactive Hover States:** Custom CSS transitions on buttons and feature cards to mimic the premium feel of the original site.

## 🎨 Design Specifications

To achieve the modern, high-tech look of Cursor, the following design tokens were used:

### Fonts
* **Primary Font:** `Inter` (sans-serif) — Used for its excellent readability in UI components and body text.
* **Secondary/Monospace:** `JetBrains Mono` or `Roboto Mono` — Used for the code snippets and IDE-style UI elements.

### Color Palette
The project uses a sophisticated dark theme with subtle gradients and high-contrast accents:

| Element | Color Code (Hex) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Main Background** | `#0B0B0B` (Deep Black) |
| **Accent Primary** | `#3D3D3D` (Muted Grey) |
| **Highlight / Glow** | `#FFFFFF` (Pure White for text and subtle radial glows) |
| **Subtle Text** | `#878787` (Medium Grey) |
| **Border / Stroke** | `#1E1E1E` (Dark Border) |

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5:** Structured with semantic elements for modern web standards.
* **CSS3:** Heavily utilizes **CSS Variables**, **Flexbox**, **Grid**, and **Blur Filters** to achieve the "glassmorphism" effect.
